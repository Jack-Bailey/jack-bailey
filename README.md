## Hi, I'm Jack Bailey

### Who am I?
I'm a Student Developer from the United Kingdom
I got interested in computers from a young age and it's been my main hobby ever since.

### What can you do?
I program mainly in C# and Python - with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for my websites

I also have other knowledge in Server Management, WordPress, cPanel and Linux

And no, I cannot fix your printer

### Where can I find out more about you?

My personal website [JackBailey.uk](https://jackbailey.uk) Is a great way to see my work, I also have a few other websites which you can find [Here](https://jackbailey.codes)

My other social media is linked on my personal website

<sub>Hint: You can go [here](https://jackb.link/staging) to see my Staging Site (This will be more impressive)</sub>

### Why is your GitHub almost empty?

A lot of the work I do I can't make OpenSource.
Although more of my work is on my Repl ([It ain't much but it's honest work](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/021/work.jpg))

<sub>I'm also too lazy to hide secrets properly  to release it</sub>
